### Method for Solving a Problem

1. State the problem clearly
    1. identify the I/O
2. Come up with example inputs and outputs to cover edge cases
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. 
    1. State in plain English **NOT CODE!!!**
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs
    1. Fix bugs, if any
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
    1. Your knowledge of common data structures comes in handy
